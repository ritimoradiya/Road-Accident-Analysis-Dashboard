# **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard**

## **About the Project**
This project presents a **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** built using **Tableau**. The dashboard provides an interactive and visual representation of road accident data, covering various casualty severities (fatal, serious, and slight) and exploring key factors influencing road safety.

## **Purpose of the Project**
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize road accident data to identify trends, risks, and insights. It aims to assist policymakers, researchers, and traffic authorities in understanding accident patterns and improving road safety measures.

## **About the Data**
The dataset includes:
- **Accident Details**: Total accidents, severity levels, and monthly trends
- **Casualty Details**: Fatal, serious, and slight casualties
- **Factors Influencing Accidents**: Weather conditions, road surface types, and vehicle types
- **Geographical Distribution**: Locations of accidents with severity classifications

## **Features of the Dashboard**
The dashboard provides the following analyses:
1. **Accident Trends**:
   - Total accidents and casualties, categorized into fatal, serious, and slight
   - Monthly trends to detect seasonal variations
2. **Casualty Severity Breakdown**:
   - Analysis of fatal, serious, and slight casualties
3. **Casualties by Vehicle Type**:
   - Detailed breakdown for cars, motorcycles, trucks, bicycles, and other vehicles
4. **Environmental Factors**:
   - Casualties by weather conditions and road surface types
5. **Casualties by Road Type**:
   - Analysis of accidents on different road types (e.g., single carriageways, dual carriageways)
6. **Geographical Analysis**:
   - Mapping accident locations with severity levels to highlight accident-prone areas


## **Results and Key Insights**
- **Accident Trends**: Casualties are distributed consistently over the months, with slight variations.
- **Severity Breakdown**:
  - Fatal casualties represent the most severe outcomes.
  - Serious casualties are less frequent but significant.
  - Slight casualties are the most common, indicating a prevalence of less severe accidents.
- **Vehicle Analysis**: Cars contribute the most to accidents, followed by motorcycles and bicycles.
- **Environmental Factors**:
  - 82% of fatal casualties occurred in fine weather.
- **Road Type Analysis**: Single carriageways are the most accident-prone road type.
- **Geographical Insights**: Accidents are concentrated in urban areas, highlighting the need for targeted road safety interventions.
